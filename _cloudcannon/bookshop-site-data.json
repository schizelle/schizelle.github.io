A musical about two people after a breakup. I figured enough stories were written about first loves and relationships and not enough about how people moved on after failed relationships. I knew I wanted this musical to be open as far as casting went with no limitations on age, gender, ethnicity, or sexuality. Afterall heartbreak is a pretty human emotion. \n<img alt=\"Heartbreak\" src=\"/images/creative_projects/dissonance/1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<style>\n  #float_right  {\n    float: right;\n    margin: 0 0 0 15px;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/creative_projects/dissonance/2.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" id=\"float_right\" /></p>\n\n<p>So Dissonance was born, the music refined with some help from Brian Tate, the storyline and staging with mentorship from Julie McIsaac, and unending support from friends and family.

She was fortunate to grow up in a household that focused on artistic as well as academic growth. Her mother, Melissa Naidu, is a piano teacher and introduced her to piano, music theory and singing.</p>  <p>Through her high school, she participated in various band, choral and drama competitions and revelled in the process of creating art with others. Simultaneously, she trained under Maureen Rebello, Talula D'Souza and Nimesh Kataria for vocals, classical piano and jazz respectively.</p>  <p>In addition to her extra-curricular activities, she gave formal exams through Trinity College of London in Music Theory, Vocals, Piano, and Electronic Keyboards. Her high school often put on year end productions of popular musicals and while performing in musicals such as Sister Act, Lion King and Joseph and the Amazing, Technicolour Dreamcoat, she realised that she wanted to explore the nuances of song and dance through theatre.</p> \n<style>\n  #float_right  {\n    float: right;\n    margin: 0 0 0 15px;\n  }\n</style> <img src=\"/images/03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" id=\"float_right\"/>\n<p>Due to the lack of musical theatre training programs, she decided to pursue a degree in Contemporary Western Vocals from the NMIMS School of Performing Arts, Mumbai. Here, she studied under incredible renowned artists such as Gino Banks, Karim Ellaboudi, Anurag Naidu, Shirish Malholtra, Clement Rooney and strengthened her foundation as a musician, composer and lyricist. She also trained her vocals under Vasundhara Vee, Gina Mirenda and Monica Luz Alvarez from India, Costa Rica and Spain respectively. Their global understanding of music gave her an opportunity to study jazz, Latin, funk and Indian fusion. She also separately trained ballet and jazz under Sasha Shetty and Dhaval Gosalia.</p>  <p>She has performed professionally for several events and companies in both Mumbai and Pune and was also one of the lead singers for The Name's Bond (tribute show) by Shamiana Productions.</p>  <p>Currently, she's pursuing a Diploma in Performing Arts from the Canadian College of Performing Arts to fulfil her dream of making a career as a professional musical theatre artist.</p>  <a class=\"c-button c-button--primary c-button--large\" href=\"/assets/pdf/MN_Resume.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Download Resume\n</a>"}],"slug":"about","ext":".html","tags":[],"excerpt":"","date":"2025-05-18 04:48:15 +0000","content":"","url":"/about/","relative_path":"_pages/about.html","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","title":"Gallery","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"page-heading","title":"Gallery","description":null},{"_bookshop_name":"gallery"}],"slug":"gallery","ext":".html","tags":[],"excerpt":"","date":"2025-05-18 04:48:15 +0000","content":"","url":"/gallery/","relative_path":"_pages/gallery.html","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","title":"Headshots","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"page-heading","title":"Headshots","description":null},{"_bookshop_name":"gallery-subpage","from":"headshots"}],"slug":"headshots","ext":".html","tags":[],"excerpt":"","date":"2025-05-18 04:48:15 +0000","content":"","url":"/headshots/","relative_path":"_pages/headshots.html","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","permalink":"/","title":"Home","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"hero","title":"<p style=\"font-family: 'Cinzel Decorative', cursive;\">Michelle</p>","description_html":"<b>Singer - Actor - Performer</b>","subdescription_html":"A versatile performer with a passion for storytelling.
