In the summer of 2023, I was alone at home - most of my friends had left for the summer and the apartment felt emptier than usual. For all intents and purposes, it was a beautiful night and I knew I wanted to write something that encapsulated how 'mopey' I felt. At the time, I didn't think much of it, just recorded a few iterations with lyrics as they came to my mind, scrawling chords on a scrap piece of paper with a Sharpie.

The second song wrote itself in a similar fashion two weeks later but by then, another idea had formed. A musical about two people after a breakup. I figured enough stories were written about first loves and relationships and not enough about how people moved on after failed relationships. I knew I wanted this musical to be open as far as casting went with no limitations on age, gender, ethnicity, or sexuality. Afterall heartbreak is a pretty human emotion.

So Dissonance was born, the music refined with some help from Brian Tate, the storyline and staging with mentorship from Julie McIsaac, and unending support from friends and family. It has been presented at the Canadian College of Performing Arts' Festival of New Works with Olivia Gentlemen and MaÃ«lys Wega bringing my vision to life. My very first musical and definitely not the last!
